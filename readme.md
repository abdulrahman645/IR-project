# Project Overview: SOA Architecture for Text Processing, Indexing, and Search Services

This project implements a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that divides the system into three main services: `TextProcessing`, `Indexing`, and `Search`. Each service plays a crucial role in processing text documents, building indexes, and facilitating efficient searches. This document outlines the architecture, functionality, and inter-service communication within this SOA setup.

## TextProcessing Service

The `TextProcessing` service focuses on preprocessing text inputs to prepare them for indexing and searching. It comprises three primary paths:

### Path 1: Tokenization
- **Functionality**: Takes a text input and returns a tokenized array.
- **Process**: Splits the input text into individual words or tokens.

### Path 2: Advanced Text Preprocessing
- **Functionality**: Performs advanced preprocessing on the text using three functions:
  - **Strip Punctuation**: Removes punctuation marks from the text.
  - **Stopword Removal**: Filters out common words (stopwords) that do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the text.
  - **Stemming**: Reduces words to their root form to group similar words together.

### Path 3: Spelling Correction
- **Functionality**: Corrects spelling errors in the text.
- **Usage**: Although initially excluded from the index-building process (`preprocessor`), it is utilized for suggesting corrections to user queries to enhance search accuracy.

## Indexing Service

The `Indexing` service builds the searchable index from processed texts. It includes two main functionalities:

### Building the Index
- **Functionality**: Utilizes the `TfidfVectorizer` to create an index based on the processed text data.
- **Process**: Converts text data into numerical vectors that represent the frequency and importance of words in the documents.

### Clustering
- **Functionality**: Groups similar documents together through clustering algorithms.
- **Process**: Identifies and organizes documents into clusters based on their content similarity.

The `Indexing` service communicates with the `TextProcessing` service to ensure that the index is built from correctly preprocessed text.

## Search Service

The `Search` service facilitates querying the indexed documents and returning relevant results. It consists of two main paths:

### Query Processing and Document Retrieval
- **Functionality**: Processes user queries, searches the index for matching documents, and presents the results.
- **Process**: Analyzes the query, identifies the most relevant documents, and suggests additional queries based on the retrieved documents' clusters.

### Query Expansion
- **Functionality**: Suggests alternative queries based on the indexed queries.
- **Process**: Searches the index for similar queries and presents them to the user for further exploration.

The `Search` service interacts with both the `TextProcessing` and `Indexing` services to ensure accurate and efficient search operations.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the SOA architecture, detailing the roles and interactions between the `TextProcessing`, `Indexing`, and `Search` services. By understanding these components and their integration, one can appreciate the modular design and the collaborative nature of the system, enabling scalable and maintainable development practices.
